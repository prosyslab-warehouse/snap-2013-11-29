snap (2013-11-29-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  Due to a name conflict with /usr/bin/snap from snapd tool to interact with
  Ubuntu Core Snappy the main executable needs to be renamed.  This snap
  package now provides the binary
  
    /usr/bin/snap-hmm

  To remain compatible with local user scripts using the name snap the old
  name of the executable is provided under the PATH
  
    /usr/lib/debian-med/bin/snap

  So if you want to use snap with its original name just do the following:
  Set the PATH variable like

    export PATH=/usr/lib/debian-med/bin:$PATH

  The PATH can be set very easily by making use of the feature of the
  med-config package of the Debian Med Blend.  Once med-config is
  installed for Bash users who create a file ${HOME}/.blends containing
  the string "debian-med" the PATH is automatically extended and thus
  users who consider themselves Debian Med users have access to the
  originally named executables.
